            the course of all other technologies. ICT has now become less of a choice and more of a requirement for individuals
            and societies concerned with competitiveness in the international arena.

            With the establishment of the Institute of Information and Communications Technology, the two (2) programs were transferred
            from CMC to IICT. By virtue of BOR Resolution No. 34, s. 2002, the Institute of Information and Communications
            Technology was established. Hence, effective 1st semester of AY 2002-2003, the BSIT and BSIM degree programs

            monitoring and evaluation of IT Education programs throughout the region, stressing adherence of all schools
            to CHED Memo Order No. 25, Series 2001 known as “New Policies and Standards in Information Technology Education.
            Thus, the Institute reviewed its BSIT and BSI curricula and came up with recommendations for curriculum revision
            to conform to the minimum requirements set by CMO No. 25, S. 2001. With approval from the Board of Regents, the
            revised BSIT and BSIM replaced the 1998 curricula starting 1st Semester, AY 2004-2005.</p>
